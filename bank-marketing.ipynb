    "\n",
    "In addition, with SVC taking close to 2 orders of magnitude longer than other models yet not yielding any increase in accuracy means it will be excluded from this point forward in the interest of time. The accompanying abstract does mention SVC coming up with the best accuracy, but over the entire dataset and very likely with a different split of training and test data if not over the entire dataset. Using GridSearchCV on it would have taken hours to run, and the one time it did finish running after hours yielded a low score, and so it was deemed not worth further experimenting with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it is worth thinking about whether accuracy is the best metric to be using. The bank wants to identify the subscribers and know how to identify people like them. Therefore, recall, calculated by the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives, is a good metric for minimizing the false negatives. In this context, false negatives are subscribers mislabelled by the model as non-subscribers and thus people the bank would miss. This is better than accuracy, which is more concerned about labelling everyone correctly, and the bank probably does not care too much about non-subscribers being labelled as subscribers as long as they are able to capture the essense of subscribers.

    "When looking to maximize ability to distinguish between subscribers and non-subscribers, to be accurate, Linear Regression was by far the best, being both accurate, achieving an accuracy score of 88.9%, and quickly trained in fractions of a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, accuracy does not quite match up with the business objective to identify subscribers to know who to market to in the future. For that, recall is used. In this, K-Nearest Neighbors did best, correctly identifying 24.8% of the subscribers in the test dataset. Fortunately, models trained by recall as the metric identified the same customer characteristics as the accuracy based models for being most important, and so the following observations can be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, contacting customers in the months of March, September, October, and December have good subscription rates, while May, July, August, and November were poor times to get people to sign up. Second, the job matters. People who were identified as students or retirees were more likely to sign up while entrepreneurs and blue collar were much less likely. Other factors, such as marital status, had much less impact."
